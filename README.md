# Live Football Scores
## Overview
The incredible amount of data on the Internet is a rich resource for any field of research or personal interest.
 **Web scraping** is a data scraping used for extracting data from websites. 
## Goal
In this project, I tried to extract the counts of your commits during the last year from the contribution section on the main page of your GitHub profile. 
So after running this code, you get the count of your commits (and plot) on each day of the week during the last year.
## Requirements
* Python 3.7.4
* ``pip install beautifulsoup4``
*  ``pip install matplotlib`` or ``python3 -m pip install matplotlib``
*  ``pip install numpy`` or ``python3 -m pip install numpy``
* ``import requests``
* ``from bs4 import BeautifulSoup``
* ``import matplotlib.pyplot as plt``
* ``import numpy as np``
## How to Run
1. You just need to run this command `` python3 webScraping.py`` in your terminal.
2. then enter your __GitHub username__ for getting the count of your commits (and plot) on each day of the week during the last year.

## Output
the output of this code (for my page) is something like this =>
